This repository contains my projects that were implemented as part of the Introduction to Clinical Data Science course at Ben Gurion University of The Negev.  </br>
During the course I have implemented 4 projects - Mortality prediction, Clustering MIMIC-IV data, Imputation approaches and the final project was to reproduce a published study.

---

The porjects were implemented in python and BigQuery, using Jupyter notebook and Google Cloud.

## Projects
1. Mortality prediction - created a prediction model for mortality in the ICU using the MIMIC-IV data set.

2. Clustering MIMIC-IV data - clustered admissions based on clinical data, and we compared the clinical data of the clusters.

3. Imputation approaches - compared different imputation approaches for predicting deliveriesâ€™ outcome: KNN imputation, Iterative imputatuin, Mean, Median, etc.

4. Final Project - reproduced a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7647525/">study</a> published by Zhao et. al. that showed that platelets counts in sepsis patients can be a predictor for one year survival. The goal of the project was to follow the same steps including population definition, features extraction, and statistical analysis using the MIMIC-IV data. Finally, I described the results and compared the differences with the original paper.
